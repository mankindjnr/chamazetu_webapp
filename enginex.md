## configure Nginx to handle SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS?

To configure Nginx to handle SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS, you need to modify the `nginx.conf` file and add a server block that listens on port 443 (the default port for HTTPS) and includes the paths to your SSL certificate and private key.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Create a new `server` block that listens on port 443.
2. Specify the `ssl` parameter on the `listen` directive to enable SSL.
3. Use the `ssl_certificate` directive to specify the path to your SSL certificate.
4. Use the `ssl_certificate_key` directive to specify the path to your private key.
5. Configure other SSL settings as needed, such as `ssl_protocols`, `ssl_ciphers`, and `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers`.

Here's an example of how you can modify your `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name yourdomain.com;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name yourdomain.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/yourdomain.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/yourdomain.com.key;

        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://chamazetu_frontend:8000;
        }

        location /api {
            proxy_pass http://chamazetu_backend:9400;
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and will route all requests to the root URL (`/`) to the `chamazetu_frontend` service and all requests to `/api` to the `chamazetu_backend` service.

You also need to modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to mount the directory containing your SSL certificate and private key to the Nginx container:

```dockercompose
version: '3.9'

services:
  # ... your other services ...

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    depends_on:
      - chamazetu_frontend
      - chamazetu_backend
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
```

In this example, the `./ssl` directory on your host machine (which contains your SSL certificate and private key) is mounted to the `/etc/nginx/ssl` directory in the Nginx container. Adjust these paths as needed for your setup.

## edit the nginx.conf

The `nginx.conf` file should be created and edited on your local machine, in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

When Docker Compose runs, it will mount the local `nginx.conf` file into the Nginx container at the path `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, as specified in the `volumes` section of the `EngineX` service in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here's a basic example of what your `nginx.conf` file might look like:

```nginx
events { }

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://chamazetu_frontend:8000;
        }

        location /api {
            proxy_pass http://chamazetu_backend:9400;
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will route all requests to the root URL (`/`) to the `chamazetu_frontend` service and all requests to `/api` to the `chamazetu_backend` service.

After you've created and edited your `nginx.conf` file, you can run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start your services. The Nginx service will use the configuration from your `nginx.conf` file.
