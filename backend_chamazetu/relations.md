Sure, let's go through each `relationship` statement:

1. `chamas = relationship("Chama", secondary=member_chama, back_populates="members", lazy="dynamic")` in `Member` class:

   This establishes a many-to-many relationship between `Member` and `Chama` through the association table `member_chama`. The `back_populates` parameter sets up a bi-directional relationship, so accessing `chamas` from a `Member` instance will give all `Chama` instances associated with that member. The `lazy="dynamic"` means that the `Chama` instances are not loaded until they are accessed. This is correct if there is a `members` attribute in `Chama` model referring back to `Member`.

2. `transaction_sent = relationship("Transaction", back_populates="sender", foreign_keys="Transaction.sender_id")` and `transaction_received = relationship("Transaction", back_populates="recepient", foreign_keys="Transaction.recepient_id")` in `Member` class:

   These establish one-to-many relationships between `Member` and `Transaction`. A member can send many transactions and receive many transactions. The `foreign_keys` parameter is used to specify which foreign key on `Transaction` should be used for this relationship. These are correct if there are `sender` and `recepient` attributes in `Transaction` model referring back to `Member`.

3. `chamas = relationship("Chama", back_populates="manager")` in `Manager` class:

   This establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Manager` and `Chama`. A manager can manage many chamas. This is correct if there is a `manager` attribute in `Chama` model referring back to `Manager`.

4. `members = relationship("Member", secondary=member_chama, back_populates="chamas", lazy="dynamic")` in `Chama` class:

   This is the other side of the many-to-many relationship between `Member` and `Chama`. This is correct if there is a `chamas` attribute in `Member` model referring back to `Chama`.

5. `manager = relationship("Manager", back_populates="chamas")` in `Chama` class:

   This is the other side of the one-to-many relationship between `Manager` and `Chama`. This is correct if there is a `chamas` attribute in `Manager` model referring back to `Chama`.

6. `transactions = relationship("Transaction", back_populates="recepient")` in `Chama` class:

   This establishes a one-to-many relationship between `Chama` and `Transaction`. A chama can receive many transactions. This is correct if there is a `recepient` attribute in `Transaction` model referring back to `Chama`.

7. `sender = relationship("Member", back_populates="transaction_sent", foreign_keys=[sender_id])` and `recepient = relationship("Chama", back_populates="transactions")` in `Transaction` class:

   These establish many-to-one relationships from `Transaction` to `Member` and `Chama`. A transaction has one sender and one recipient. These are correct if there are `transaction_sent` attribute in `Member` model and `transactions` attribute in `Chama` model referring back to `Transaction`.

In summary, the relationships seem to be correctly defined, assuming the `back_populates` attributes exist on the related models.
