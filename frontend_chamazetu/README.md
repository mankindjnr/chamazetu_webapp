# Validation of Token

1. Local Validation: Depending on your use case, you might be able to validate the JWT token locally without making a request to the API. This would be faster and reduce load on the API server. However, it would only work if the token is signed with a secret key that your application knows.

```python
import jwt
from jwt.exceptions import InvalidTokenError

def memberdashboard(request):
    access_token = request.COOKIES.get('access_token')

    # Local validation
    try:
        jwt.decode(access_token, 'your-secret-key', algorithms=['HS256'])
    except InvalidTokenError:
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('membersignin'))
```

2. Caching: If you have a lot of users, you might want to cache the results of the token validation to reduce the number of requests to the API server. You could use a local cache like Redis or Memcached, or a distributed cache like Memcached or Redis.

3. Token Refresh: JWT tokens often come with a refresh token that can be used to get a new access token when the current one expires. If your API supports this, you could automatically refresh the token instead of redirecting the user to sign in again

**A refresh token is typically a separate token that is issued along with the access token. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to get a new access token without requiring the user to authenticate again. If you want to implement refresh tokens in your application, you would need to create a separate function to generate the refresh token and another endpoint to handle the refresh token exchange.**

4. Error Handling: You should add error handling for the case when the request to the API fails for reasons other than an invalid or expired token. For example, the API server might be down.

## 4 & 5

```python
 # API request
    try:
        current_user = requests.get('https://sj76vr3h-9000.euw.devtunnels.ms/users/me', headers={'Authorization': access_token})
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return render(request, 'error.html', {'message': 'API request failed'})

    if current_user.status_code == 200:
        return render(request, 'chama/dashboard.html', {'current_user': current_user.json()})
    else:
        # Token refresh
        refresh_token = request.COOKIES.get('refresh_token')
        new_token_response = requests.post('https://sj76vr3h-9000.euw.devtunnels.ms/refresh', data={'refresh_token': refresh_token})

        if new_token_response.status_code == 200:
            new_access_token = new_token_response.json()['access_token']
            response = render(request, 'chama/dashboard.html', {'current_user': current_user.json()})
            response.set_cookie('access_token', new_access_token)
            return response
        else:
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('membersignin'))
```

5. Logging Out: You should also add a logout feature that deletes the JWT token from the browser. This would prevent the user from accessing the protected pages even if they have the JWT token.

## Handling token expiration and refresh in django

you can handle token expiration and refresh using Django's middleware. Middleware is a series of hooks that Django provides for you to process requests and responses globally before they reach the view or after they leave the view.

```python
 import jwt
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.urls import reverse
import requests

class TokenRefreshMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        access_token = request.COOKIES.get('access_token')

        # Decode the token without verification to get the expiry time
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(access_token, options={"verify_signature": False})

        # If the token has expired
        if decoded_token['exp'] < time.time():
            refresh_token = request.COOKIES.get('refresh_token')
            new_token_response = requests.post('https://your-api-url/refresh', data={'refresh_token': refresh_token})

            if new_token_response.status_code == 200:
                new_access_token = new_token_response.json()['access_token']
                response = self.get_response(request)
                response.set_cookie('access_token', new_access_token)
                return response
            else:
                return redirect(reverse('membersignin'))

        return self.get_response(request)
```

This middleware checks if the access token has expired before each request is processed. If the token has expired, it attempts to refresh the token. If the token refresh is successful, it sets the new access token in a cookie. If the token refresh fails, it redirects the user to the sign-in page.

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'yourapp.middleware.TokenRefreshMiddleware',
    # ...
]
```

Remember to replace 'yourapp.middleware.TokenRefreshMiddleware' with the actual Python import path of your middleware class, and 'https://your-api-url/refresh' with the actual URL of your API's token refresh endpoint.

# secrets in docker-compose

In Docker, secrets such as environment variables are typically stored in a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. This file is not included in version control systems like Git for security reasons.

To view the secrets, you can open the `.env` file in your text editor.

Please note that you should never share this file or its contents as it contains sensitive information. If you can't find the `.env` file, the secrets might be set in another way, such as directly in the shell or through a secrets management tool.

## COOKIES INSIDE CONTAINERS

mankindjnr: can container affect how cookies are set?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, the container in which your application is running can affect how cookies are set. This is particularly true when it comes to the domain and secure attributes of the cookie.

- **Domain**: If your application is running in a container, the domain of the cookie should match the domain that the container is mapped to. If the domains do not match, the cookie will not be sent in the HTTP request.

- **Secure**: If your application is running in a container and the container is not configured to use HTTPS, setting the secure attribute of the cookie to True will prevent the cookie from being sent in the HTTP request. This is because the secure attribute instructs the browser to only send the cookie over an HTTPS connection.

In your case, you are setting the secure attribute to True. If your container is not using HTTPS, this could be why your cookies are not being set correctly. You would need to either configure your container to use HTTPS or set the secure attribute to False.

However, it's important to note that setting the secure attribute to False is less secure because it means the cookie can be sent over an unencrypted connection. If the cookie contains sensitive information, this could potentially expose that information to attackers. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use HTTPS whenever possible.

mankindjnr: how can i configure the container to use https

GitHub Copilot: Configuring your container to use HTTPS involves creating an SSL certificate, configuring your application to use this certificate, and then exposing the HTTPS port in your container.

Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Generate SSL Certificate**: You can generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL. This is suitable for development, but for production, you should use a certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

2. **Configure Your Application**: Configure your application to use the SSL certificate. This step depends on the web server or application server you are using. For example, if you are using Django's development server, you can use the `sslserver` extension:

```bash
pip install django-sslserver
```

Then in your Django settings:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'sslserver',
    ...
)
```

And run your server with:

```bash
python manage.py runsslserver --certificate /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem
```

3. **Dockerfile Configuration**: In your Dockerfile, you need to expose the HTTPS port (usually 443) and copy the SSL certificate files into the container:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
...
COPY ./path/to/cert.pem /cert.pem
COPY ./path/to/key.pem /key.pem
...
EXPOSE 443
...
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runsslserver", "--certificate", "/cert.pem", "--key", "/key.pem"]
```

4. **Docker Run**: When running your Docker container, you need to map the container's HTTPS port to a port on the host machine:

```bash
docker run -p 443:443 your-image-name
```

Remember, this is a general guide. The exact steps may vary depending on your application and environment.

## Testing HTTPS Inside Containers

To test your application's HTTPS functionality, you can use the following methods:

1. **Browser**: Simply navigate to your application using a web browser. Make sure to use `https://` in the URL. If the application loads without any security warnings, then HTTPS is working correctly.

2. **Curl**: You can use the curl command-line tool to make a request to your application. Here's an example:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8000
```

The `-k` or `--insecure` option allows curl to make insecure connections, which is necessary because you're using a self-signed certificate.

3. **Python Requests**: You can use the requests library in Python to make a request to your application. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://localhost:8000', verify=False)
print(response.status_code)
```

The `verify=False` option allows requests to make insecure connections, which is necessary because you're using a self-signed certificate.

Please note that these methods are for testing purposes only. You should not use the `-k` or `--insecure` options or the `verify=False` option in a production environment. In a production environment, you should use a certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), and you should always verify the server's SSL certificate.

# CELERY BEAT SCHEDULER

The error message you're seeing indicates that the table `django_celery_beat_periodictask` does not exist in your database. This table is created by the Django Celery Beat library, which is used for scheduling tasks in Django projects.

If you've just added Django Celery Beat to your project, you may need to apply its migrations to create the necessary database tables. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

If you've already run this command and are still seeing the error, it's possible that there's an issue with your database connection, or that the migrations were not applied correctly. You may want to check your database settings and consider re-running the migrations.

- after adding the `celery_beat_scheduler` service to your `docker-compose.yml` file and running `docker-compose up`, the Celery beat scheduler should start running in a separate Docker container. It will start scheduling the tasks defined in your Celery configuration at the specified intervals.

You can monitor the logs of the `celery_beat_scheduler` service to see when it schedules tasks. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f celery_beat_scheduler
```

This command will show the logs of the `celery_beat_scheduler` service and follow the log output (`-f` stands for "follow"). When the beat scheduler schedules a task, it will output a log message, so you can see when each task is scheduled.

You can also monitor the logs of the `celery_worker` service to see when it executes tasks. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f celery_worker
```

This command will show the logs of the `celery_worker` service. When the worker executes a task, it will output a log message, so you can see when each task is executed.
