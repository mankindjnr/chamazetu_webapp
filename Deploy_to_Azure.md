mankindjnr: give me a step by step guide on how to deploy this web app in microsft azure

GitHub Copilot: To deploy this Docker Compose application on Microsoft Azure, you can use Azure App Service. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a Resource Group**
   - Open Azure portal and click on "Create a resource".
   - Search for "Resource Group" and click "Create".
   - Fill in the details like Resource Group name and Region, then click "Review + Create".

```bash
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West Europe"
```

2. **Create an App Service Plan**
   - In the Azure portal, click on "Create a resource".
   - Search for "App Service Plan" and click "Create".
   - Fill in the details like Name, Resource Group, Operating System (Linux), Region, Pricing tier, then click "Review + Create".

```bash
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku B1 --is-linux
```

3. **Create a Web App**
   - In the Azure portal, click on "Create a resource".
   - Search for "Web App" and click "Create".
   - Fill in the details like Name, Resource Group, Runtime Stack (Docker), Operating System (Linux), Region, App Service Plan, then click "Review + Create".

```bash
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name <app-name> --multicontainer-config-type compose --multicontainer-config-file docker-compose.yml
```

4. **Configure App Settings**

   - Go to the created Web App and click on "Configuration" under Settings.
   - Click on "+ New application setting" and add all the environment variables required by your application (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB, FRONTEND_POSTGRES_USER, FRONTEND_POSTGRES_PASSWORD, FRONTEND_POSTGRES_DB).

5. **Deploy the Application**

   - Push your code to a Git repository.
   - In the Azure portal, go to the created Web App and click on "Deployment Center" under Deployment.
   - Choose the source control (like GitHub) and configure the build provider (like App Service build service).
   - Choose the repository and branch, then click "Continue".
   - Review the settings and click "Finish".

6. **Access the Application**
   - Once the deployment is done, you can access the application by navigating to `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`.

Please replace `<app-name>` with the name of your application. Also, replace `myResourceGroup` and `myAppServicePlan` with your own names.

mankindjnr: How can I configure a custom domain for my Azure Web App?

GitHub Copilot: To configure a custom domain for your Azure Web App, follow these steps:

1. **Purchase a Domain**

   - If you don't already own a domain, you'll need to purchase one from a domain registrar.

2. **Add a DNS Record**

   - Go to your domain registrar's website and add a DNS record. The type of record depends on whether you want to use a root domain (like `example.com`) or a subdomain (like `www.example.com`).
     - For a root domain, create an `A` record that points to the IP address of your Azure Web App.
     - For a subdomain, create a `CNAME` record that points to the default URL of your Azure Web App (`<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`).

3. **Add the Custom Domain in Azure**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your Web App and click on "Custom domains" under Settings.
   - Click on "+ Add custom domain".
   - Enter your domain name and click "Validate". Azure will check the DNS record.
   - If the validation is successful, click "Add custom domain".

Here's an example of how to add a DNS record in Azure CLI:

```bash
az network dns record-set a add-record --resource-group myResourceGroup --zone-name example.com --record-set-name "@" --ipv4-address <app-ip-address>
```

And here's how to add a custom domain in Azure CLI:

```bash
az webapp config hostname add --webapp-name <app-name> --resource-group myResourceGroup --hostname <your-domain>
```

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your Azure Web App, `<app-ip-address>` with the IP address of your Azure Web App, and `<your-domain>` with your custom domain. Also, replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of your resource group.

To configure SSL/TLS for your custom domain in Azure Web App, follow these steps:

1. **Purchase an SSL Certificate**

   - You can purchase an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA). You'll need to provide a certificate signing request (CSR) during this process.

2. **Upload the SSL Certificate to Azure**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your Web App and click on "TLS/SSL settings" under Settings.
   - Click on "Private Key Certificates (.pfx)" and then "+ Upload Certificate".
   - Upload the .pfx file of your SSL certificate and enter the password.

```bash
az webapp config ssl upload --certificate-file <path-to-pfx-file> --certificate-password <password> --name <app-name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

3. **Bind the SSL Certificate to Your Custom Domain**
   - In the "TLS/SSL settings" page, click on "Bindings" and then "+ Add TLS/SSL Binding".
   - Select your custom domain and the uploaded SSL certificate, choose the SSL type (SNI SSL is recommended), and click "Add Binding".

```bash
az webapp config ssl bind --certificate-thumbprint <thumbprint> --ssl-type SNI --name <app-name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your Azure Web App, `<path-to-pfx-file>` with the path to your .pfx file, `<password>` with the password of your .pfx file, and `<thumbprint>` with the thumbprint of your SSL certificate. Also, replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of your resource group.

Please note that Azure also provides free managed certificates for Web Apps, but they only support `www` subdomains and require the App Service plan to be in the B1 tier or higher.

The excerpt you provided already contains the steps to configure custom SSL certificates for an Azure Web App. Here's a summary:

1. **Purchase an SSL Certificate**

   - You can purchase an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA). You'll need to provide a certificate signing request (CSR) during this process.

2. **Upload the SSL Certificate to Azure**
   - In the Azure portal, go to your Web App and click on "TLS/SSL settings" under Settings.
   - Click on "Private Key Certificates (.pfx)" and then "+ Upload Certificate".
   - Upload the .pfx file of your SSL certificate and enter the password.

```bash
az webapp config ssl upload --certificate-file <path-to-pfx-file> --certificate-password <password> --name <app-name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

3. **Bind the SSL Certificate to Your Custom Domain**
   - In the "TLS/SSL settings" page, click on "Bindings" and then "+ Add TLS/SSL Binding".
   - Select your custom domain and the uploaded SSL certificate, choose the SSL type (SNI SSL is recommended), and click "Add Binding".

```bash
az webapp config ssl bind --certificate-thumbprint <thumbprint> --ssl-type SNI --name <app-name> --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of your Azure Web App, `<path-to-pfx-file>` with the path to your .pfx file, `<password>` with the password of your .pfx file, and `<thumbprint>` with the thumbprint of your SSL certificate. Also, replace `myResourceGroup` with the name of your resource group.
